# Introducing DAORA

My name is Tim. I've spent my entire career at the intersection of data and software delivery. I've run big and small engineering teams and have spent a significant portion of my time thinking about increasing the speed and quality of delivery for both software and data products. 

Throughout my career, the best body of work I've found for helping teams improve their delivery is the DORA framework. It provides a comprehensive set of capabilities, metrics and guides to help teams improve their software delivery performance.

DAORA is my attempt to translate the DORA framework into a set of capabilities, metrics and guides for data and AI teams. My hope is that this will help organizations accelerate their data and AI practices to maximize value for their internal and external stakeholders.

## What is DORA?

DORA is a framework developed by a group of researchers who started independently and were later acquired by Google. They publish a yearly report on the state of software delivery performance and provide an extensive set of capabilities, metrics and guides to help teams improve their software delivery performance.

## What is DAORA?

DAORA stands for Data and AI Operations Research and Assessments. It is a body of work for data and AI teams to help them improve their delivery performance. It is based on the DORA framework and is designed to help teams improve their data and ML/AI ops practices.

### DAORA pillars

As I continue to work through building out this body of work I'm hoping to engage the following communities:
